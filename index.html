					<h2>Ethan</h2>
					<p>Ethan is 14 weeks old.  He loves watching his brother and smiles all of the time.  Ethan has a condition called craniosynostosis.  This means that the sutures in his skull are fusing prematurely.  The fusion causes an odd head shape because the skull can not expand as it normally would.  This condition affects 1 in 2000 births and will require a craniotomy.</p>
